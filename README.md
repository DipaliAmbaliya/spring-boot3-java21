  - **spring.threads.virtual.enabled** to enable virtual threads in your application.This setting works both for the embedded Tomcat and Jetty.
- Spring MVC and WebFlux URL Matching Changes
  - the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to false. We can change the default with global Spring MVC configuration
- Jakarta EE
  - Spring Boot 3 has migrated from Java JEE to Jakarta JEE APIs for almost all dependencies.Jakarta EE now uses jakarta packages rather than javax.

- Observability
    - Observability is the ability to observe the internal state of a running system from the outside. It consists of the three pillars logging, metrics and traces.
    - SpringBoot 3 offers us the ObservationRegistry interface that can be implemented to create observation which provides a single API for both metrics and traces.
- Web Flux Enhancements
  - New PartEvent API to stream multipart form uploads
  - JDK HttpClient integrated with WebClient.
- Http Interfaces
    - The Spring Framework lets you define an HTTP service as a Java interface with annotated methods for HTTP exchanges. You can then generate a proxy that implements this interface and performs the exchanges. This helps to simplify HTTP remote access which often involves a facade that wraps the details of using the underlying HTTP client.
      Prior to Spring Boot 3 for use the RestTemplate or WebClient to construct call.In Spring Boot 3 you can declare an interface with the methods you would like to support.Next, create a proxy that will perform the declared HTTP exchanges.
- Problem Details for HTTP APIs
    - A common requirement for REST services is to include details in the body of error responses. The Spring Framework supports the "Problem Details for HTTP APIs" specification
    - check ExceptionHandlerAdvice.java
- Zipkin
  - A new JDK HttpClient based Zipkin sender has been implemented. This sender only depends on the JDK and will be the default sender in Spring Boot 3, superseding the WebClient and RestTemplate sender implementations.
- Miscellaneous 
  - ListCrudRepository 
  - PagingAndSortingRepository no longer extends CrudRepository 
  - Apache HTTP client a JdkClientHttpConnector will now be auto-configured 
  - The @SpringBootTest annotation can now use the main of any discovered @SpringBootConfiguration class if itâ€™s available. This means that tests can now pick up any custom SpringApplication configuration performed by your main method.
